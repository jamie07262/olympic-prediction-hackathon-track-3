![olympic](https://roadgenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/paris-2024-olympic-games-1536x864.jpg)
## Overview

This project, developed during the Codedex Hackathon by Franchesca, Daniella, and Saumya, aims to predict outcomes for the 2024 Olympics using advanced statistical methods and machine learning. We utilized historical Olympics data from Kaggle to build our models and collaborated on Google Colab. As our first virtual hackathon experience, we earned a participation badge and gained valuable insights through the process.

##Team Contributions
- Franchesca: Developed data visualizations and applied linear regression techniques. Currently planning to improve the project to explore more about data analysis and practice frontend development.
- Daniella: Focused on Poisson distribution, the Dixon-Coles model, TensorFlow integration, and analyzed home advantage.
- Saumya: Designed and delivered the presentation of our methodology, findings, and results for submission.

## Project Components
### Data Visualization & Linear Regression

- Implemented diverse visualizations to explore and understand the historical Olympics data.
- Applied linear regression to forecast outcomes for the 2024 Olympics based on past performance.

### Poisson Distribution & Dixon-Coles Model

- Utilized Poisson distribution to model the number of goals and other relevant metrics.
- Applied the Dixon-Coles model to adjust predictions for low-scoring events.
- Integrated TensorFlow to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Analyzed the impact of home advantage on Olympic outcomes.

### Presentation

- Developed a comprehensive presentation to showcase our methodology, findings, and results usign microsoft powerpoint.

## Current Status

The components related to the Poisson distribution, Dixon-Coles model, TensorFlow integration, and home advantage analysis are not yet fully functional and do not provide the desired predictions.  I am planning to improve these aspects, focusing on exploring more about data analysis and frontend development. This includes developing a website to display the data and predictions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly React.

## Future Plans

- Improve the prediction model to achieve more accurate results.
- Develop a user-friendly web interface to display data visualizations and predictions.
- Integrate React for a more dynamic and interactive user experience.
